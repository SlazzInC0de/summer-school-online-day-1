HTML Elements - Simple Explanation
<html>
The very first tag for your web page. Everything else you write goes inside it.

<head>
Holds info about the page, like its name in the browser tab. You don't see this part on the page itself.

<title>
Sets the name that appears in your browser tab.

<body>
This is where all the things you see on your web page go (text, pictures, forms, etc.).

<h1> to <h6>
These are headings for titles and sections. <h1> is the biggest, and <h6> is the smallest. They help organize text.

<p>
Used for a normal paragraph of text.

<a>
Makes text a clickable link. It can take you to another page or website.

<ul> and <li>
<ul> makes a list with bullet points. Each item in the list is an <li>.

<ol> and <li>
<ol> makes a list with numbers. Each numbered item is also an <li>.

<img>
Puts a picture on your page. You need to tell it where the picture is using src.

<div>
A simple, invisible box used to group parts of your page together, like a section.

<hr>
Draws a straight line across your page to separate sections.

<table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>
These work together to make tables for data. <table> is the whole table, <tr> is a row, <th> is a column title, and <td> is a normal data cell.

<form>
Used to make a form where people can type information.

<input>
A small box inside a form for typing things like names or emails.

<label>
Connects text to an input box, so you know what to type there (like 'Your Name').

<textarea>
This is a bigger box in a form, used for typing longer messages or comments.

<br>
Adds a simple line break, like pressing Enter for a new line of text.

Why I used these input types:

type="text"
For basic text like a name, or for parts of a date (Day/Month/Year).

type="email"
For email addresses. It helps check if it looks like an email.

type="tel"
For phone numbers. Helps mobile phones show a phone keypad.

type="submit"
Makes a button that sends all the form information.

type="checkbox"
To let users pick more than one option (like Email OR Phone).

type="radio"
To let users pick only one option from a list.

type="range"
To let users pick a value from a slider (like how satisfied they are).

How my navigation works:

I grouped my navigation links inside a <div> (a simple box) with a small heading. Then, I used a bullet list (<ul> and <li>) for each page link. Each link is an <a> tag. The href part inside <a> tells it which HTML file (like about.html, contact.html, or portfolio.html) to open when you click. It's how you jump between my portfolio pages.
