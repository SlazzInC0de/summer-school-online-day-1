        <h3>Who I Am??</h3>
        <p>
            Hello! Myself Suryansh Verma. I am a 2nd year CSE student at MIT Bangalore. <br>
            I am an aspiring individual with a passion for web development, currently building foundational skills in HTML while pursuing an internship @ Techible.
            My journey into the digital world began with a keen desire to understand how websites are built from the ground up.
            I am currently focused on mastering HTML, the foundational language of the web, to ensure a strong base for future development endeavors.<br>
            This portfolio serves as a demonstration of my early project.

        <h3>My Approach to Work</h3>
        <p>
               My academic approach to computer science and development emphasizes a robust understanding of fundamental principles. 
               This is exemplified in my meticulous attention to detail in HTML structuring, and further extends to my studies in Object-Oriented Programming (Java), Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and Data Visualization. 
               I prioritize building a solid conceptual groundwork as a prerequisite for tackling advanced technical challenges and ensuring continuous improvement in my skillset.

        <h3>Future Aspirations</h3>
        <p>
            Looking ahead, I aim to expand my skillset to include CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity,
            eventually building dynamic and responsive web applications. My goal is to contribute to meaningful
            web projects and solve real-world problems through technology.
